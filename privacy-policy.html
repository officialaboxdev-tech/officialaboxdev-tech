  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how personal data is handled in the aMod – Sandbox Game application.</p>

  <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>

    We do not collect or store any personal data directly. However, our app integrates third-party services, including

  <ul>
    <li>Device information (e.g. model, OS, device identifiers)</li>
    <li>IP address</li>
    <li>Approximate location</li>
    <li>In-app activity and interactions</li>
    <li>Advertising data (e.g. views, clicks, engagement)</li>

  <h2>3. Data Deletion Requests</h2>
